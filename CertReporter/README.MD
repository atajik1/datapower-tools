# READM.md for Certificate Reporter

**Certificate Reporter** is a Python script that will build a report of all certificate objects on a DataPower system. The output MetaData is displayed in your browser in a grid layout. Each column is sortable by clicking on the column header.
Any certificate that is due to expire in a settable number of days (default: 90) is highlighted in the report.
